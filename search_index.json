The COVID19 curriculum covers the following modules: Module I: Introduction Module II: Types of Rapid Tests Module III: Validation of Test Kits Module IV: Quality Management in Testing Center Module V: Set-up and Workflow in Testing Center Module VI: Practical training "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Background", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Background In Lebanon, the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the lives of inhabitants and forced the country to devise public health policies to reduce the pace of transmission. The new registered cases in the region, as shown in the graph, show a erratic pattern. This pattern will likely to continue as long as there is no control over the spread of the virus. The graph was updated on 12/07/2021. Source: Our world in data The socio-political tensions and the large refugee populations have increased the disease burden of COVID-19. The support of first responders are particularly necessary to implement effective disease control measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 persistence and transmission. Measures that are designed to reduce aerosol transmission within the population must be implemented, which include universal masking and regular, widespread testing to identify and isolate infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Testing of SARS-CoV-2 is central to COVID-19 management and relies heavily on rt-PCR technology. For public health measures, another approach is needed in which the focus is to determine within minutes whether a person is infectious, instead of determining if a person is carrier of the virus (nucleic acid). For rapid and cheap SARS-CoV-2 testing, a large number of rapid tests are offered on the global market. The reliability of the test should undergo thorough examination before they are allowed for use. After validation, test kits should be monitored continuously. The training explains the different types of rapid tests. The participants will learn to setup and perform a validation of a rapid test. Secondly, the participants will learn to conduct continues quality monitoring. Finally, the participants will learn to setup save and efficient workflows in testing-centres. This guide for trainers describes the material and activities that can be applied to achieve the optimal outcomes when transferring knowledge and practices on controlling COVID-19.

For workshops, it is recommended for optimal learning experience and management that the number of participants do not exceed five (maybe six) participants per instructor. This number is small enough for all participants to be fully engaged, yet large enough for a variety of experiences and viewpoints to be represented. 4.1 Facilities and equipment For in-person trainings, the environment should be large enough for training, discussion and the simulation. The trainings or workshops can be held in a well-lit, ventilated, distraction-free classroom with sufficient tables and chairs, and conveniently located outlets for a computer and projection monitor. To facilitate discussion and interaction among participants, tables should be arranged in a semi-circle, or classroom-style, giving all participants an unobstructed view of the projection monitor. Avoid overcrowding. It is important to consider social distancing requirements when preparing the training venue and limit the training to smaller groups. Bottled water and glasses should be made available on each table. Facilities must be available for participants to clean their hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub). Refer to local guidelines for measures that must be in place for workshops of this nature. Make arrangements well in advance of the workshop to procure or secure the necessary materials, supplies and kits. Do not forget to arrange for transport of these items to the workshop site. 4.2 Target audience The training can be provided to lab technicians, lab managers, first responders, quality managers, or anyone involved in SARS-CoV-2 screening. The setup and content of the training is adequate for all backgrounds and levels of expertise. The training participants should have general knowledge of diagnostic settings and familiar with general aspects of infectious diseases and hygiene. 4.3 Course Language Training material are provided in English.

Small quiz for recap. 5.2.2 Narrative Sheet 02 - Introduction In this module, I will discuss different types of rapid tests for the detection of Corona infections. Countries across the world are facing difficulties containing COVID outbreaks. Testing and contact tracing have a large impact on reducing transmission of the virus. To strengthen the identification of people carrying the virus, there is a large demand for rapid tests, which are also called lateral flow tests. Manufacturers are competing on the market with different types of rapid tests, assuring that their product is of the highest quality. So, if manufactures are confident in the performance of their tests, do we need to validated them ourselves? Before we handle this question, let us first examine what types of rapid tests are available and what their advantages and disadvantages are, and what they can be used for. Sheet 03 – Learning Objectives This presentation will take around 15 minutes. We will discuss the basic principles of current Coronavirus tests and their advantages and disadvantages. Different types of tests also have different compliance criteria. The type of compliance criteria depends on how and for what the test is used for. By the end of this module, you will understand why test validation is needed. In the next module, we will learn about the validation procedure itself. Sheet 04 – Why validating? Scandals on inferior medical devices are unfortunately common. How is it possible that such devices are still being sold? How does this system work and where do the responsibilities of different stakeholders start and end? As an example, in 2014, journalists made up a medical device, a Pelvic Floor Net for the treatment of Pelvic Organ Prolapse. The product was a fruit net for oranges. The journalists wrote a brochure and a technical briefing for it. The conclusion was that their product met the certificate requirements for medical devices and was allowed to to be sold on the market. This is an extreme example, but it does expose the shortcomings of regulatory affairs. That being said, if regulatory affairs are too strict, it would be very hard to manage outbreaks such as the one we are facing now. For diagnostic tests being bought to market during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, quality control markings do not always guarantee a reliable test as one type of test may work better in one setting and not in another. Therefore, the test needs to be checked, or validated, to see if it works in a slightly different setting and circumstance. Sheet 05 – Types of Tests I Different types of SARS-CoV-2 tests have different purposes. In general, there are four types of tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. On the left, you see a cross-section of the Coronavirus. The virus particle has these yellow spikes on the outer membrane sticking out. These spikes can be captured by antibodies that are attached to a surface and subsequently coloured with a dye. A well-known example are these rapid lateral flow tests. (Show rapid test for the camera). Sheet 06 – Types of Tests II These spikes are on the outside. To reach the inside of the virus, the particle needs to be treated with specific reagents in a test tube. The released genetic material of the virus can then be detected using the Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis, or PCR test. Sheet 07 – Types of Tests III In a later stage of virus infection, the human body’s immune system is catching up with the infection and is releasing specific antibodies in the bloodstream. These specific antibodies can be detected with the so called serology tests. This is an indirect detection approach for exposure to the virus as it detects human produced antibodies and does not detect the virus itself. Sheet 08 – Types of Tests IV Other kinds of molecules or biomarkers are released by the human body during an infection. These molecules can be detected and recognized with sensitive equipment. For example, spectrometry analyzers are used for the detection of specific quantities of small volatile molecules such as acetone, ethanol, and others. Other biomarker tests are biochemical tests include C‐reactive protein, measures of anticoagulation or blood clotting, and immune cells such as white blood cell count. Then there also imaging-biomarkers, such as X-ray or CT-scan. These are commonly available tests and may be helpful for the triage of people with possible COVID‐19 in imaging the lungs Antigen and PCR tests can directly detect SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, while serology and biomarkers are indirect detection methods and rely on how the human body reacts to infection. They each have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on what they are exactly used for. Sheet 09 – Characteristics I Let’s compare these different types of tests. Molecular or PCR-based tests are considered the gold standard. They are versatile and the most reliable test for diagnosing covid patients. Usually, these tests take a day: samples need to be transported to a laboratory. Then the samples are processed, analyzed, checked, and double-checked. Test reagents and equipment are expensive. Therefore, a PCR test is only cost-effective when they are performed in large quantities. Some PCR tests are less expensive or quicker, such as LAMP and the GeneXpert. Still, these tests require specialized expertise and lab equipment. Serology is less expensive compared to molecular tests. In general, serology is not used for the first diagnosis of Covid infection. Antibody tests are likely to be available in laboratory form using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA methods. But also as a point‐of‐care test, using one or two spots of blood from a thumb prick on a testing strip. It takes around 10 minutes for a positive answer. Contrary to the antigen test. They are quick, cheap, and require little training. The price, however, is that these rapid antigen tests are less reliable. Several other rapid tests are being developed, validated, and applied. It ranges from breath analyzers to sniffing insect bees. I have grouped these with ‘Others.’ Choosing the right testing method depends on the objective of the test and the available resources. Is for diagnosing a patient? Or for monitoring donated blood units? Sheet 10 – Characteristics II The most important indicators for the reliability of a test, are the sensitivity, and specificity of the test. Let’s imagine we have a population. Most of them, the blue ones, do not carry the Coronavirus. The yellow ones carry the virus but don’t know this yet. The number of viruses they have is very low and they do not feel sick. The red ones have high viral loads and are really sick with symptoms. Sheet 11 – Characteristics III The PCR test performs very well in being ’positive’ with persons carrying the virus. Including the ones that are not sick. The test has excellent sensitivity. There are hardly any false negative patients. Sheet 12 – Characteristics IV In another type of test, those persons that carry a low number of viruses can be missed when the test has a low sensitivity. This type of test is definitely not recommended in a setting with vulnerable persons, for example in a maternity ward or an elderly home. Sheet 13 – Characteristics V With the uninfected people, here, the test result is always ‘negative.’ Hardly anyone gets a false-positive result. The test has a great Specificity. Sheet 14 – Characteristics VI Low specificity comes when negative persons receive test result which says they positive for the infection with the virus. Now, this does not immediately mean that this test is useless. If this test is quick and cheap, the ‘negative persons’ can carry on. The positive ones, need to be double-checked with a more reliable test. This, for example, would work in a setting for screening travellers. For the sensitivity, it’s always better to have it as high as possible. But in some settings, one has to make a trade-off. Less sensitivity for a faster and cheaper test. This is a complicated decision. Sheet 15 – Setting As showed, all types of tests have their advantages and disadvantages. The first step before introducing a new test is to ask a few basic questions: For who is the test? Do we need to quickly screen passengers? Do we need to diagnose a sick person? Do we need to monitor the environment or food products? What kind of samples are available? Throat or nose swabs? Feces? Wastewater? Where is the test conducted? At a laboratory? In a mobile health unit? At home? These questions are all part of formulating the objective when a new test is to be validated. Sheet 16 – Criteria Once it is clear what the setting is, the list with tests can be further shortened by setting several criteria. Do new reagents work with the equipment already in the lab? What does the manufacturer state about the sensitivity and specificity? And will the manufacturer be able to provide enough test reagents for the near future? Also important is if it is affordable? Are there any legal obligations before the test can be purchased? Are the correct storage options available? This information is all part of the validation plan. Sheet 17 – Planning of Validation I The reliability of a test does not only depend on the test itself. For validating the test, processes associated with the collection and production of the outcome needs investigation. It has to be confirmed that all processes provide sufficient assurance that the results are reliable. The validation also justifies why specific processes are needed. Now, it is impossible to put all these processes into one validation. Sheet 18 – Planning of Validation II There are many actors involved in the successful implementation of a test. For example, if storage at customs was inadequate, the reagent might have deteriorated and can have a direct impact on the reliability of the tests. The lab may validate as much as they can, the test results remain unreliable. Therefore, it can be very rewarding to sit down with relevant stakeholders and put yourself in their situation. It gives a better understanding of all challenges. By facing the challenges together, you might come up with an alternative for choosing the appropriate test. Sheet 19 – Summary There was an overview of the types of tests that are being applied for detecting SARS-CoV-2. It is made clear that one cannot just simply compare one test with another. Especially when they are applied in different settings. 5.2.3 In-depth questions 5.2.3.1 Question 1 Question 1 Answer 1 Throat swab: or oropharyngeal samples can be used for PCR-based assays to detect the viral RNA, and for antigen rapid tests for the detection of virus-proteins. Serum or plasma: antibodies in plasma and serum can be detected with serology assays. ‘PCR-assays’ can be used to quantify viral RNA in blood, however, it is less sensitive and more invasive compared to oropharyngeal- and nasal swabs. Breath sample: detects volatile molecules / chemicals. Usually used for fast screening of ‘negative patients,’ as the test result can be often ‘false positive.’ Nose sample: or nasal sample are used for antigen- and PCR-test assays. Environment / waste water: these samples are collected to monitor the amount of viral particles from human excretion. Viral RNA is extracted from the waste water and detected with the sensitive PCR-assays. Blood transfusion: samples are usually analysed with serology for the detection of antibodies for monitoring the prevalence in the human population. Active screening of blood products with PCR is not recommended as 1) blood donor’s are asymptomatic during donation, 2) viral loads in blood with COVID-19 are usually low, in particular with asymptomatic persons and 3) the virus is deactivated during the processing of blood-plasma. 5.2.3.2 Question 2 Question 2 Answer 2 For the sensitivity of 50%; of all persons carrying the virus, in only half of them the test became positive. Regarding the specificity of 83%; in all six persons that do not carry the virus, in one person the test became ’false positive. The study population of 12 is too small to draw reliable conclusions on sensitivity and specificity. 5.3 Module III - Validation of test kits 5.3.1 Content Length 14 minutes presentation Learning goals The participants can: create a validation report Summary Steps for validation of a rapid test are explained. Rationale: why is this validation needed for? For example, conventional tests are expensive and shortage of consumables. Objective: What is the primary (and secondary) question that needs to be answered? For example, what is the sensitivity? Study population: Rapid tests are validated on well-defined user group. For example persons with Covid symptoms from the age of 16+, willing to participate, etc. Methods: Ethical review, Statistics, primary &amp; secondary endpoints (use dummy graphics), procedure (questionnaire, sampling, type of tests, storage, transport, testing) Main study endpoints: explain what will be measured? What is the reference standard? Tools &amp; setup Ask participants to turn of (sound of) mobile telephones Explain if and when questions can be asked. Relevant literature. PowerPoint slides. Presenter in front of slides. Small quiz for recap. 5.3.2 Narrative Sheet 03 - Training topics II In the previous module, the main message about using new tests is that one should not work blindly on promises of the manufacturer or salesperson. With a validation plan, we want to measure if the promises made by the manufacturer meet real-life situations. Sheet 04 - Protocol synopsis These are the steps that will be briefly discussed. Of course, a plan does not need to be limited to these chapters. The first chapter is about explaining why the validation is carried out. The Objectives state what exactly is going to be measured. The Study design is how the study is set up. Chapter 4 explains which tests are going to be used. Chapter six, who are the subjects and what type of samples are taken. In methods, the procedures are explained in detail. For chapter eight i will not explain the methods, but I’ll illustrate the input and output of data. Last but not least, the ethical aspects of the study. Sheet 05 - 1. Rationale &amp; Background During the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the laboratory capacity quickly runs to its limit and reagents were getting scarce. The time between getting a patient sample until giving out the test result, also became an important factor in the fight against Covid. Besides time, also costs needed to go down. These are clear rationals to implement new rapid tests: increase the speed of testing and decreasing costs. Once a manufacturer or distributor of a new test is appointed, the test itself should be verified. The manufacturer might promise 99% sensitivity, however, it might have been tested on sick hospital patients shedding high loads of viruses. In your case, you might want to apply the test on asymptomatic persons that had close contact with an infected person. [PHOTO] Or, at the airport for pre-boarding Covid spreaders, you might want to replace the body thermometer with a more sensitive breath analyzer. [PHOTO] Validation can also be set up if a current process needs to be adapted. For example to check if there is a difference in sensitivity if one swab from the nasopharynx has the same sensitivity as to when taking a double nasopharynx swab together with a throat-swab. [PHOTO] The rationale is to convince others why a change or investment in a new method is needed. Sheet 06 - 2. Objectives I Suppose we want to check a new rapid test, the main objective is to check the sensitivity and specificity of the test. How many false positives and false negatives are detected with this new test? Here, it needs to be clear who exactly the subjects are, and what kind of samples are being used. It also needs to be clear what the reference method is. The reference can be supplemented with more criteria, such as subjects with specified clinical symptoms. Sheet 07 - 2. Objectives II The experiment could be a good opportunity to gather more information, besides the test itself. For example, a questionnaire could show that many persons get tested is because they think they got infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 5G radiation. In that case, a lot of resources could be saved by starting an information campaign. Correlation with Ct-values means if there is a pattern the positive and negative outcome of the rapid tests, and the strength of the PCR signals, which is expressed as Cycle-threshold values, or Ct values. Hence, the objective of the plan is the research question, or the hypothesis: what exactly do I want to measure or reproduce? Sheet 08 - 3. Study design The chapter on study design is a more technical explanation of how the experiment is set up. In general, a test validation can be conducted in a completely controlled environment in the laboratory. There is total control over the parameters: samples were stored in the freezer and concentrations of virus in the positive samples are well-defined. The negative samples could be spiked with several respiratory viruses, other than SARS-CoV-2, to check if the tests show cross-reaction with other viruses. The test reagents are stored at the same temperature and the equipment is handled by one researcher. The lab-based performance or technical validation is usually already performed by the manufacturer. In a clinical evaluation, there are many more uncertainties, a good representation of real-life. Samples are taken from multiple sites, by different persons, over a period of time, from unknown test subjects. The study is blinded, which means that the technicians who are testing the samples do not know if the samples are positive or negative. The results are compared by an independent person. Sheet 09 - 4. Index &amp; Reference Test Index and reference test. In short, describe the test or maybe several tests that need to be validated, and to what the method is being compared to. It must be taken into account that, although PCR is considered the gold standard, it is also not 100% sensitive and specific. Sheet 10 - 5. Study setting In this chapter, it is described where the samples are coming from. Are the swab samples and data coming from one site or multiple sites? It might be important when the demography of the subjects is described. A testing centre at the university campus will provide samples from more young persons, and thus likely to have samples with lower viral loads. So, location can also be important for the interpretation of the results. Sheet 11 - 6. Study population As mentioned in the previous sheet, age can be an important factor and needs to be recorded to assure that the sample population is a representative cross-section of the general population. The same applies to gender. This chapter also needs to describe the inclusion criteria. For example, children until 16 are excluded. Also, persons that are mentally or physically unable to provide consent, should be excluded. The test is validated for asymptomatic persons, therefore, subjects need to be excluded from the study when they present Covid symptoms. Basically, what is needed is a homogenous study population that represents the study objective. Sheet 12 - 7. Methods Here, a diagram shows all the steps during the study. It starts when the subject presents itself at the reception, all the till the final analysis of the test results. The chapter also describes the procedures, among other how the swabs are taken and the PCR analysis. These procedures can also be described in validated standard operation procedures, which I will discuss in my next module. Different forms, such as the questionnaire and the consent form can be added as an appendix to the validation plan. Sheet 13 - 8. Statistical analysis I In this module I will not discuss the statistical methods: that would take too long… and boring for some. The important point here is that, it would be very unfortunate if, at the end of the study, it appears that conclusions cannot be made. Simply because we forgot to ask the age of the subjects. How would we know for sure that we have an honest representation of the general population? All work might have been done for nothing. Another tip is to structure all data. The most annoying thing for me as a data scientist is to clean up data and use my own interpretation on the collected data. For example, if the reason for testing says “Family.” What does that mean? Traveling to family? A family member was Covid positive? Basically, if garbage data goes in, garbage results come out. Sheet 14 - 8. Statistical analysis II Here is an example of the statistical analysis. The numbers for this graph are made up by the way. It’s for illustration only. At the bottom of the graph are the results of the rapid antigen test. Blue dots on the left are antigen positive, and the yellow dots are antigen negative. On the left side, it says PCR. Often the PCR results are expressed in Ct-values. The lower the Ct-value, the stronger the signal, meaning that there were many viruses in the samples. So, if the Ct-value has a higher number, it means there were fewer viruses in the sample. It goes up until it reaches a threshold. In this case, the Threshold is value number 45. Above 45, there were no or too little virus particles to be detected. For the data analysis, however, I gave the PCR negative results the artificial Ct-value 50. All test results with Ct value above 45… or if no virus was detected, the sample gets Ct value 50. In the right column with yellow Antigen negative test results, you can see that many of them still provided a positive PCR result. Most of them were weak-positive, and have a high Ct-value. This is to be expected. In the left column with blue Antigen positive test results, almost all of them were also detected with PCR. There is, however, one exception. One single blue dot above the threshold. The antigen was positive but the PCR was negative. Maybe the PCR test went wrong. There was maybe an air bubble in the reaction tube. Maybe the technician made an error and swapped a sample? Still, I would not worry too much about it with these results. In any case, making some sketches of possible graphs and tables, before the actual experiment starts, can help to improve the objective and setup of the experiment. Sheet 15 - 9. Ethics For clinical experiments, consent of the participant is mandatory, at least in most places. Consent is needed to use the samples and information from the participants. But ask yourself: what information do I need to reach my objectives? Do I really need the ethnicity of the participant? Do I need to know their religion? What is the worst case-scenario if all collected information would be stolen? Another example, suppose the rapid test is negative. But later the PCR shows to be positive. Do I need to inform the patient? A few things to consider: if persons are to be informed, then private contact details will have to be collected. Furthermore, if the PCR analysis is performed two weeks later, is it then still worth tracing back the patient? Sheet 16 - Summary We went through every chapter of the validation plan. The most important points are: Describe the objective of the evaluation. Make sure that the setup of the experiment is well thought through, and does not need to be adapted halfway through, because we ran out of one reagent. Therefore, it is important to involve all parties that play a role in the validation. From finance to chauffeur. Also, statisticians, they can fix mistakes, but only to a certain level. Better to involve them in the set-up. And last but not least, the ethics involved with the validation. 5.3.3 In-depth questions 5.3.3.1 Question 1 Question 1 Although antibodies do not necessarily indicate an ‘active infection,’ in combination with respiratory symptoms does make it very likely. The lower sensitivity of rapid antigen tests is the trade-off for ease-of-use, low price and fast result. Not antigen, but antibody assays are used for sero-prevalence surveys. The sero-conversion (development of antibodies in blood serum) appear several days after infection or vaccination. Hence, with the negative Ab RDT, the person can still have a recent infection. 5.3.3.2 Question 2 Question 2 Answer 2 This question reflects a situation where PCR-testing is not or limited available. 5.4 Module IV - Quality Management 5.4.1 Content Length 12 minutes presentation Learning goals The participants can: Argue the need of standard procedures. Judge if a batch can be released. Evaluate potential risks during the testing procedures. Summary Topics of the module include: What is Quality Management and why do we need it? Why do we need Standard Operation Procedures?( for example for using the rapid test) Batch release. Risk assessment. Tools &amp; setup Ask participants to turn of (sound of) mobile telephones Explain if and when questions can be asked. Relevant literature. PowerPoint slides. Presenter in front of slides. Small quiz for recap. 5.4.2 Narrative Sheet 03 - Learning objectives First of all, the terms SARS-CoV-2 and COVID may be used interchangeably. SARS-CoV-2 is the correct term for the virus, but I will sometimes abbreviate it simply as Covid. Second, the focus is mainly on Quality Management for settings where rapid antigen tests are used. Still, the information can also be applied for other settings. Now, about Quality management. This term might be considered as some upper level vague concept. In reality, quality management affects every single step and procedure inside and outside the laboratory. From receiving the patient or client, to submitting the test result. Any weak link or error in the course of actions could set in a chain reaction with disastrous effects in the end. It can be something small as not monitoring the temperature of the refrigerator, or getting sloppy with personal protection. I will discuss these types of risks, their consequences and how to avoid them. Sheet 04 - QC/QA/QM Quality control, quality assurance and quality management, these terms might be confusing. In general, they can be described as follows. Sheet 05 - Quality Control I Quality control involves the continuous evaluation or monitoring of the performance of the Covid Antigen Rapid diagnostic tests. This is to ensure that all steps are correctly followed, steps that are required for accurate diagnosis. Quality control consists of samples with from which it is known they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. These reference samples are used regularly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and national policy. It is advisable to perform QC testing at least once a week or more frequently if the testing site has conducted a high number of tests. Another moment to perform a Quality control test is when a new batch or lot number of Antigen rapid tests is going to be deployed. At least five samples (three positive and two negative) should be tested for each new lot. One could add rapid tests both from the ones currently in use, and from the new lot number Quality control fluids may be supplied with the Covid Antigen test kit. If materials are not supplied with the kit, they can be purchased kit supplier or a third-party provider. Another method is to pool positive and negative patient material. If the quality control results do not match the expected results, Quality control has failed. Investigation and corrective actions are required. Patient test results cannot be released if quality control fails. Sheet 06 - Quality Control II Quality control for the release of new batches does not only apply for the rapid tests. It applies for all consumables, including the swabs, the masks, the disinfection fluid. New material and batches need to be checked and evaluated if they meet the specified requirements. This is a picture made at a testing site. The wagon containing material that do not pass the quality control. For example these swabs.. [Show swabs that did not pass QC] Sheet 07 - Quality Assurance The next level concerns quality assurance. Even if all material passed their quality control test, if they are used in a wrong matter, the patient can still be sent out with the false result. Given the need to quickly roll out COVID Antigen Rapid testing, a full Quality Assurance system may not be in place when testing is started. Therefore, to maximize quality, it is essential that a good-quality Rapid Diagnostic Test product is purchased, and then transported and stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The users must be trained and supervised, but with a mechanism in place for them to report concerns and complaints. The essential components of Quality assurance should be introduced in the following order: 1. QC testing 2. Supervisory visits or audits 3. New lot testing, or new lot verification of incoming kits 4. Proficiency testing Sheet 08 - Quality Management Quality assurance requires a lot of organization. The personnel on the ground do not have time for this. Also they might be biased. Quality management usually in the hands of a dedicated Quality Manager. The manager does not necessarily need to have a technical background, and knows all the in's and out's of the laboratory. The role of the quality manager is to assure that procedures are kept in place. The manager organised the internal audits. The manager receives any incident reports and makes sure they are being followed up. In short, quality control is about materials, quality assurance how materials are being used, and quality management how everything is organized. Sheet 09 - EQA There are a few more elements regarding Quality Assurance, which are grouped as External Quality Assurance. Before the testing site is opening its doors, a supervisory visit can assess the readiness of the place. On the website of this module you can download an example of a testing site readiness checklist. After the testing has started, the site can be assessed periodically, for example four times per year. Or more often when there are frequently problems recorded. You can also download the testing site supervisory checklist. A proficiency testing program can be used to identify and resolve problems in diagnostic testing. Well characterized samples can be used for proficiency testing. The sample could for example contain different loads of the virus. Samples can be purchased from external agencies, for example NEQAS. Samples can also be exchanged between testing sites. For Quality Assurance, patient samples could also be retested at a different site. However, this is not advisable due to the practicality of collecting multiple samples and the safety associated with their transport. Sheet 10 - Root cause analysis Failed proficiency test, or any other major mistake, requires investigation. The reason for the error need to be uncovered. This is called root cause analysis. An example of a tool is this fish bone method, where different areas are systematically examined. When the root cause has been identified, corrective action must take place. Furthermore, preventive actions should prevent the reoccurrence of the mistake. These errors and actions must be documented by the testing site. Sheet 11 -When do errors occur? - I Before entering the testing site, clients need to sanitize their hand with alcohol dispenser. They are first directed to the breath analyzer. If the analyzer is negative, the client is safe and can go out. If the analyzer result is 'undetermined', the client needs to do a rapid PCR or LAMP test. However, it quickly becomes clear there is something wrong with the analyses. At the end of the day, almost all clients test results become undetermined. The root cause is the alcohol hand sanitizer. The breath analyzer is too sensitive. The corrective action is to stop using the breath analyzer and direct all clients to the LAMP test. The preventive action is to introduce lactic acid and ban all alcohol disinfectants around the breath analyzer. With the new preventive action, samples are run in parallel both with the breath analyser and the LAMP test. Sheet 12 -When do errors occur? - II In another setting where rapid antigen tests are used. It's very convenient as test results are provided on the spot. The number of patients grow quickly, and then the weekly reports show that the percentage of positive patients is increasing significantly, from 12 % to 45%. An increasing number of patients complained that they had to go into quarantine, but never tested positive in the following days. The root cause analysis showed that when there are a lot of customers, the technicians sometimes failed to check the results after 15 minutes. Sometimes the results were checked after 30 minutes. Antigen can become false positive when they are left too long. A solution was to buy the manual kitchen timers and put is with each rapid test. Also, when it becomes busy, the floor manager is helping in the process. Sheet 13 -When do errors occur? - III After the testing is done, the test results are shared with the customers. The next day, however, it became clear that the results of two patients with the same name were swapped. One was false positive and went into quarantine. Also, also the close contacts also went for Covid testing. The other person who was tested false negative, became ill the next day. After giving sincere apologies, the close contacts of the Covid patient had to be traced. Clearly, using the patient name as a single identifier is not enough. Sheet 14 -Summary In this presentation it was explained what quality control, assurance and management are. Several tools and examples were shown on how to implement quality assurance at a testing site. One of the tools is root cause analysis, for the continues improvement of the testing facility. 5.4.3 In-depth questions 5.4.3.1 Question 1 question 1 answer 1 ‘The technician did not swab the client’ is false. The control line detects any antibody taken with the swab from the patient. If the client would not be swabbed, there would not be any antibody and, therefore, no control line at all. A throat swab was used instead of a nose swab; in both cases, human material is taken and the control line should therefore be clearly visible. The test kit is deficient: This can be the reason. For example a production failure or not well stored. Not enough specimen-fluid: This can also be the reason. Specimens of two client exhanged: false. Both clients should provide a positive control band. 5.4.3.2 Question 2 This question goes deeper in the issue with faint control line. This is an open question where several possible root causes are listed as examples. 5.5 Module V - Workflow 5.5.1 Content Length 15 minutes Learning goals The participants can: Design a proper and safe workflow in a routine testing facility. Summary Proper registration procedures are explained to avoid mis-diagnosis. Biosafety work procedures for the protection of staff, clients and environment, which also include safe discard of waste. Examples of crowd control methods are shown to improve the testing-flow and a safe environment for the clients and staff. Tools &amp; setup Ask participants to turn of (sound of) mobile telephones Explain if and when questions can be asked. Relevant literature. PowerPoint slides. Presenter in front of slides. Small quiz for recap. 5.5.2 Narrative Sheet 03 - Learning Objectives After this presentation, you will be familiar with the design of a proper and safe workflow in a rapid testing center. Safe for both the clients and the staff. Not all details can be covered in a quarter of an hour. Still, hoping that by showing some examples, it will inspire you and you will come up with new ideas and solutions to improve the testing facility. Sheet 04 - Testing center area sheet 04 When a large new testing center is set-up, it might be naturally to fit it with existing facilities, for example in a hospital. However, the large influx of visitors can cause problems, for example from traffic jams and large crowds. Is is therefor recommended for the testing area to set up in places that can be easily reached and has plenty of parking space. On the sketch the testing center is in between two areas. One for the clients and the other for staff. The areas can be separated by fences. Traffic controllers check at the entrance if visitors come for testing, and not because they want to park their car and go shopping at the nearby mall. The traffic controllers can also help prevent that the testing center gets overcrowded. Other things to consider when the testing site is set up, are canals to drain excess of water during heavy rain, or damage from heavy winds. Here is a picture of a testing-site in The Netherlands [PHOTO_04_1] . The entrance and exit are clearly marked. Also the Emergency exits need to be clearly visible. [PHOTO_04_2] Some visitors may be handicapped or are less mobile. A dedicated parking space for immobile clients close to the entrance might be helpful. Some of the waste should be considered as biohazard. [PHOTO_04_3]. The waste can be disclosed from the public and marked with a biohazard sign. Sheet 05 - Small test center sheet 05 Here is a sketch from a small test centers. These can be opened up at any location. It can even be a transformed cafeteria [PHOTO_05_1] or a camping van [PHOTO_05_2]. On the lay-out you can see that the clients all follow one direction. At the entrance the host asks if the client has specific symptoms and can check the temperature. The client receives a questionnaire [PHOTO_5_3], which might be translated into different languages. The clients can fill in the questionnaire separately at a table. Next, they hand over the paper to the sample taker. [PHOTO_05_4; PHOTO_05_5] . Another staff member receives the samples together with the client forms. This person makes sure that the results are read at 15 minutes, for example by using these cooking clocks [PHOTO_05_6] The testing site can have an additional person who is responsible for the inventory and jumps in when extra help in needed. Furthermore, there should be a clear protocol for certain situations. What if the client has COVID-symptoms? What should be done when a test result is positive? What should be done when the quality control of the test fails? This is all part of the Quality Management of the site, which was discussed in the previous module. Sheet 06 - Large test center I sheet 06 Here, the lay-out of a large testing facility is drawn. The yellow part is the dedicated Clients area. The green part is the area for the staff and where clients are not allowed. Behind the testing-booths, there is a separate corridor. The staff can reach the testing booths from behind, and they don't have to cross the area with the clients. In the next slide I will go step by step at each location inside the testing center. Sheet 07 - Large test center II sheet 07 First the clients area. All the way at the left is the entrance, still outside the center. The client disinfects the hands and walks down the aisle. As you can see, the client has to make this detour to reach the reception. The detour takes around 30 seconds, exactly the time needed for the hand-disinfectant to do its job. The host at the reception can do the first intake. For example, to check if the clients has their identification with them. The host can provide instructions to go to an available booth. [PHOTO_07_1] If it concerns a child for example, they can be directed to a special booth that is arranged specially for children. Or direct someone to a booth that is accessible for their wheelchair. [PHOTO_07_2] The booths can have red or green light or monitor screens to indicate if the booth or lane is available. Here is a photo of the registration counter. [PHOTO_07_3] There is glass in between. On the glass there is clearly indicated that the ID-card can be presented in the square on the glass. This to prevent that clients push their papers directly under the glass. Next, the client moves to sampling spot behind the booth. Here, attention should be paid that there is no mismatch between the client, and the information on the test-tube. There can be for example a centralized computer system where a sticker with a bar-code comes out of a label printer at the sampling spot. [PHOTO_07_4] Still, the person taking the sample should always double check if the information on the test-tube matches the information from the client. When sampling is done, the client is directed to the exit. [PHOTO_07_5] Colored lines on the floor can help the client to reach the nearest exit. Outside, the client can wait for the test result. Sheet 08 - Large test center III sheet 08 Now we enter the testing facility from the staff entrance. The personnel can lock their properties in in the wardrobe. In the lunch area, before the shift starts, the personnel gets the latest updates and their work-sheets. After a coffee, the staff goes to the room where they put on their personal protective equipment or PPE. [PHOTO 08_1 &amp; 08_2]. The tables should be clearly labeled that they are clean. Meaning, no used PPE are allowed on or around the table. This can also be highlighted with green and red tape. For large testing sites, basic walkie talkies can be used [PHOTO_08_3] to stay in contact with colleagues, without the need of walking around with potential contaminated dressing and equipment, or shouting for assistance. Here is a pictures of two lanes separated with a wall [PHOTO_08_4]. The lane on the right is for staff. The left lane is for clients, with the blue line on the floor that directs them to the exit. The staff member walks through the staff-corridor to their booth [PHOTO_08_5]. At the booth, the administrator takes seat behind the desk. If the place is well ventilated, he or she does not need full PPE. However, proper distance should be kept from from the colleague behind who is taking swabs from clients. The person taking swabs makes sure that there is plenty of material. [PHOTO_08_06] before he or she starts the shift. The tubes with the swabs can be collected and moved to the test station. There, they are tested with the Ag rapid tests or rapid PCR tests. [PHOTO_08_7] This picture is taken from a PCR laboratory, which needs an air-confined containment. Here, the samples are passed to the air-controlled laboratory through a lock with two windows. This strict air-containment is not needed when Antigen or serology tests are performed. If samples need to be send to a different location, they can then be stored in a refrigerator. [PHOTO_08_8] These can be for example samples collected for additional genotyping analysis for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 strains. Sheet 09 - Large test center IV sheet 09 Basically, at the test-center we need personnel for administration, we have a person taking the samples, a person collecting all the samples and moving them to the test station. We have someone dedicated to fill up the inventory. If a problem occurs on the floor, for example a mismatch with someones identification, a floor manager can jump in and provide assistance. Occasionally it can happen that someone gets a bleeding nose, or that someone faints. These clients can be helped in the first-aid room by someone who is trained for this. Sheet 10 - Drive through sheet 10 These are picture of a drive through testing site. It is the same principle, although clients do not get their test-result in person, but receive them by email or on an app. At the entrance the host directs the client to an available lane. Engines should be turned of when the care is standing still to protect staff from car-fumes. There is a parking spot at the back if, for example there an administrative or medical problem, and assistance is needed from the floor manager. Sheet 11 - Training of staff sheet 11 Some advice on training of new staff. [PHOTO_11_01]. Be strict at the training. If during the training the sample-taker is very anxious on taking swabs, don't push it and do not continue to train this person for this task. [PHOTO_11_02] Do the trainings in small groups, for example up to five persons. This for Covid safety reasons, but also to be able to observe the students closely. [PHOTO_11_03] If they don't follow the hygiene rules strictly, or show up late, or are impolite, then, at the end of the day, they should be asked not to continue. Personnel that are not reliable in their behavior and work ethics, they can put other staff members in danger. For the protection of clients and colleagues, the staff needs to be trained for a strict hygiene mindset. Sheet 12 - Safe workspace sheet 12 [PHOTO_12_1] Again, make sure all staff is well trained on hygiene and biosafety. For example, storage room for PPE is strictly of-limits for someone who was taking swabs. Or when receiving items from the clients. [PHOTO_12_2]. Security personnel might sometimes be needed at large testing sites. Clients can become frustrated and angry and attack the staff. Or to prevent theft. [PHOTO_12_3] At large testing sites, walkie talkies can be useful, if they are used properly. Make sure staff know how to use them. Who do you need? But do not use full names. But for example, when you are the swab taker and you ran out of swabs, say: \"Stock person for Swab-person at booth 5, over\". You can also use code words if it is for everyone and quick action needs to be taken. Code green for minor problems. Code orange incase of a more pressing issue, for example a client with a bleeding nose. And code red for all hands on deck, someone is attacking your colleague. [PHOTO_12_4] For first aid, a separate space can be set-up. [PHOTO_12_5] There should be copies of emergency procedures on all working areas. For example what to do in case of a biting incident. [PHOTO_12_6] Emergency exits are clearly indicated. Fire extinguisher are regularly checked and smoke detectors are placed. Sheet 13 - Tips &amp; Tricks sheet 13 [PHOTO_13_1] Set-up dedicated areas where staff and clients are separated as much as possible. For a fast through put, set-up a one-directional flow. [PHOTO_13_2] Also, make everything as dummy-proof as possible. Both for the clients and for the staff. Make clear marks, which areas are clean and which areas are dirty/ or potentially contaminated. Also, everyone understands the definition of 'Clean' and 'Dirty. [PHOTO_13_3] Not only children may need special care and attention, also the parents may need to be addresses. Some parents might yell at their children, causing them to be even more distressed. Some staff members might be better in handling these kind of situation than others. Also, some rewards might be given to children. A diploma for bravery and some sweets. Sheet 14 - Summary sheet 14 There was an overview of the types of tests that are being applied for detecting Covid. It is made clear that one cannot just simply compare one test with another. Especially when they are applied in different settings. Module three explained how to validate a new test for a large scale testing program. Module 4, explained about continues monitoring and quality assurance of a testing site. And in this module, the set-up of a large and small testing sites was presented. 5.5.3 In-depth questions 5.5.3.1 Question 1 question 1 answer 1 Left picture: Stock items should be clean. The lab preparator carries potentially contaminated samples. The desk of the sample taker is exposed to potential COVID-19 patients. The administration should be shielded from clients and sample-taking area to keep is ‘clean.’ Right picture: The sample taker is not wearing gloves. The hands should be clean if the gloves were removed properly. Only then, (s)he can pick up the ‘clean’ walkie talkie. All the rest should be considered as potentially contaminated or ‘dirty.’ "],["pract.html", "Chapter 6 Practical trainings 6.1 Introduction to Practical training 6.2 Donning &amp; Doffing 6.3 Sample taking &amp; rapid test 6.4 Standard Operation Procedures 6.5 Root Cause Analysis 6.6 Design test site 6.7 Setup test site 6.8 Simulate test site", " Chapter 6 Practical trainings This chapter lists several practical exercises that can be conducted in groups of 5 to 10 persons.

Each group presents their Risk assessment. Material Risk_assessment.docx, one print (A3) for each group. 6.6 Design test site Length 1 hour Learning goals Participants can: sketch a testing site lay-out differentiate clean- and dirty zones Summary The participants work together with minimal support from the teacher to design a test site. The test site should be a small scale testing facility for the simulation in the training room. Participants can take a role for each part in the design, e.g. logistics, administration, lab, crowd-control, swab-taking… Setup This practical should be done after the Worlflow presentation of module 5. Trainer explains definitions of 'Dirty' and 'Clean'. Trainer explains that participants need to set-up and simulate a test-center according to the design they are preparing. Material Flip-over Marker pens, at least three different colors Beamer, screen, computer &amp; speaker 6.7 Setup test site Length 45 minutes Learning goals Participants can: Create a testing facility taking into account the essential standards for a safe and high-throughput testing-flow. Summary This practical follows the ‘presentation on Workflow’ and the ‘practical on Design test site.’ The participants work together with minimal support from the teacher to set-up the test site. Setup Ideally, the test-center has a separate entrance and exit. Participants use their design and the material to furnish the test-center. The trainer should intervene as little as possible as the participants might encounter flaws in the design by themselves during the simulation. Assign roles for participants: Host, administrator, sample-taker, clients, observer (quality manager). Each participant chooses a personage and fills in the personality traits. For example, a bossy floor manager, an aggressive client, a clumsy sample-taker. The auditor should take more the role of the observer.
