<p>
After this presentation, you will be familiar with the design of a
proper and safe workflow in a rapid testing center. Safe for both the
clients and the staff. Not all details can be covered in a quarter of an
hour. Still, hoping that by showing some examples, it will inspire you
and you will come up with new ideas and solutions to improve the testing
facility.

<blockquote>
<p>
<p>When a large new testing center is set-up, it might be naturally to fit
it with existing facilities, for example in a hospital. However, the
large influx of visitors can cause problems, for example from traffic
jams and large crowds.</p>
<p>Is is therefor recommended for the testing area to set up in places that
can be easily reached and has plenty of parking space. On the sketch the
testing center is in between two areas. One for the clients and the
other for staff. The areas can be separated by fences. Traffic
controllers check at the entrance if visitors come for testing, and not
because they want to park their car and go shopping at the nearby mall.
The traffic controllers can also help prevent that the testing center
gets overcrowded. Other things to consider when the testing site is set
up, are canals to drain excess of water during heavy rain, or damage
from heavy winds. Here is a picture of a testing-site in The Netherlands
[PHOTO_04_1] . The entrance and exit are clearly marked. Also the
Emergency exits need to be clearly visible. [PHOTO_04_2]</p>
<p>Some visitors may be handicapped or are less mobile. A dedicated parking
space for immobile clients close to the entrance might be helpful.</p>
Some of the waste should be considered as biohazard. [PHOTO_04_3]. The
waste can be disclosed from the public and marked with a biohazard sign.

<p>
<p>Here is a sketch from a small test centers. These can be opened up at
any location. It can even be a transformed cafeteria [PHOTO_05_1] or a
camping van [PHOTO_05_2].</p>
<p>On the lay-out you can see that the clients all follow one direction. At
the entrance the host asks if the client has specific symptoms and can
check the temperature. The client receives a questionnaire
[PHOTO_5_3], which might be translated into different languages. The
clients can fill in the questionnaire separately at a table. Next, they
hand over the paper to the sample taker. [PHOTO_05_4; PHOTO_05_5] .
Another staff member receives the samples together with the client
forms. This person makes sure that the results are read at 15 minutes,
for example by using these cooking clocks [PHOTO_05_6]</p>
The testing site can have an additional person who is responsible for
the inventory and jumps in when extra help in needed. Furthermore, there
should be a clear protocol for certain situations. What if the client
has COVID-symptoms? What should be done when a test result is positive?
What should be done when the quality control of the test fails? This is
all part of the Quality Management of the site, which was discussed in
the previous module.

Here, the lay-out of a large testing facility is drawn. The yellow part
is the dedicated Clients area. The green part is the area for the staff
and where clients are not allowed. Behind the testing-booths, there is a
separate corridor. The staff can reach the testing booths from behind,
and they don't have to cross the area with the clients. In the next
slide I will go step by step at each location inside the testing center.

<p class="caption">sheet 07</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
<p>First the clients area. All the way at the left is the entrance, still
outside the center. The client disinfects the hands and walks down the
aisle. As you can see, the client has to make this detour to reach the
reception. The detour takes around 30 seconds, exactly the time needed
for the hand-disinfectant to do its job. The host at the reception can
do the first intake. For example, to check if the clients has their
identification with them. The host can provide instructions to go to an
available booth. [PHOTO_07_1] If it concerns a child for example, they
can be directed to a special booth that is arranged specially for
children. Or direct someone to a booth that is accessible for their
wheelchair. [PHOTO_07_2] The booths can have red or green light or
monitor screens to indicate if the booth or lane is available.</p>
<p>Here is a photo of the registration counter. [PHOTO_07_3] There is
glass in between. On the glass there is clearly indicated that the
ID-card can be presented in the square on the glass. This to prevent
that clients push their papers directly under the glass. Next, the
client moves to sampling spot behind the booth. Here, attention should
be paid that there is no mismatch between the client, and the
information on the test-tube. There can be for example a centralized
computer system where a sticker with a bar-code comes out of a label
printer at the sampling spot. [PHOTO_07_4] Still, the person taking
the sample should always double check if the information on the
test-tube matches the information from the client.</p>
When sampling is done, the client is directed to the exit.
[PHOTO_07_5] Colored lines on the floor can help the client to reach
the nearest exit. Outside, the client can wait for the test result.

<blockquote>
<p>
<p>Now we enter the testing facility from the staff entrance. The personnel
can lock their properties in in the wardrobe. In the lunch area, before
the shift starts, the personnel gets the latest updates and their
work-sheets. After a coffee, the staff goes to the room where they put
on their personal protective equipment or PPE. [PHOTO 08_1 &amp; 08_2].
The tables should be clearly labeled that they are clean. Meaning, no
used PPE are allowed on or around the table. This can also be
highlighted with green and red tape.</p>
<p>For large testing sites, basic walkie talkies can be used [PHOTO_08_3]
to stay in contact with colleagues, without the need of walking around
with potential contaminated dressing and equipment, or shouting for
assistance. Here is a pictures of two lanes separated with a wall
[PHOTO_08_4]. The lane on the right is for staff. The left lane is for
clients, with the blue line on the floor that directs them to the exit.</p>
<p>The staff member walks through the staff-corridor to their booth
[PHOTO_08_5]. At the booth, the administrator takes seat behind the
desk. If the place is well ventilated, he or she does not need full PPE.
However, proper distance should be kept from from the colleague behind
who is taking swabs from clients.</p>
<p>The person taking swabs makes sure that there is plenty of material.
[PHOTO_08_06] before he or she starts the shift.</p>
The tubes with the swabs can be collected and moved to the test station.
There, they are tested with the Ag rapid tests or rapid PCR tests.
[PHOTO_08_7] This picture is taken from a PCR laboratory, which needs
an air-confined containment. Here, the samples are passed to the
air-controlled laboratory through a lock with two windows. This strict
air-containment is not needed when Antigen or serology tests are
performed. If samples need to be send to a different location, they can
then be stored in a refrigerator. [PHOTO_08_8] These can be for
example samples collected for additional genotyping analysis for
monitoring SARS-CoV-2 strains.

<p>
Basically, at the test-center we need personnel for administration, we
have a person taking the samples, a person collecting all the samples
and moving them to the test station. We have someone dedicated to fill
up the inventory. If a problem occurs on the floor, for example a
mismatch with someones identification, a floor manager can jump in and
provide assistance. Occasionally it can happen that someone gets a
bleeding nose, or that someone faints. These clients can be helped in
the first-aid room by someone who is trained for this.

<p>
These are picture of a drive through testing site. It is the same
principle, although clients do not get their test-result in person, but
receive them by email or on an app. At the entrance the host directs the
client to an available lane. Engines should be turned of when the care
is standing still to protect staff from car-fumes. There is a parking
spot at the back if, for example there an administrative or medical
problem, and assistance is needed from the floor manager.

</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some advice on training of new staff. [PHOTO_11_01]. Be strict at the
training. If during the training the sample-taker is very anxious on
taking swabs, don't push it and do not continue to train this person
for this task. [PHOTO_11_02] Do the trainings in small groups, for
example up to five persons. This for Covid safety reasons, but also to
be able to observe the students closely. [PHOTO_11_03] If they don't
follow the hygiene rules strictly, or show up late, or are impolite,
then, at the end of the day, they should be asked not to continue.
Personnel that are not reliable in their behavior and work ethics, they
can put other staff members in danger. For the protection of clients and
colleagues, the staff needs to be trained for a strict hygiene mindset.

<p class="caption">sheet 12</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>
<p>[PHOTO_12_1] Again, make sure all staff is well trained on hygiene and
biosafety. For example, storage room for PPE is strictly of-limits for
someone who was taking swabs. Or when receiving items from the clients.
[PHOTO_12_2]. Security personnel might sometimes be needed at large
testing sites. Clients can become frustrated and angry and attack the
staff. Or to prevent theft. [PHOTO_12_3] At large testing sites,
walkie talkies can be useful, if they are used properly. Make sure staff
know how to use them. Who do you need? But do not use full names. But
for example, when you are the swab taker and you ran out of swabs, say:
"Stock person for Swab-person at booth 5, over".</p>
<p>You can also use code words if it is for everyone and quick action needs
to be taken. Code green for minor problems. Code orange incase of a more
pressing issue, for example a client with a bleeding nose. And code red
for all hands on deck, someone is attacking your colleague.</p>
<p>[PHOTO_12_4] For first aid, a separate space can be set-up.</p>
<p>[PHOTO_12_5] There should be copies of emergency procedures on all
working areas. For example what to do in case of a biting incident.</p>
[PHOTO_12_6] Emergency exits are clearly indicated. Fire extinguisher
are regularly checked and smoke detectors are placed.

clean and which areas are dirty/ or potentially contaminated. Also,
everyone understands the definition of 'Clean' and 'Dirty.</p>
[PHOTO_13_3] Not only children may need special care and attention,
also the parents may need to be addresses. Some parents might yell at
their children, causing them to be even more distressed. Some staff
members might be better in handling these kind of situation than others.
Also, some rewards might be given to children. A diploma for bravery and
some sweets.

There was an overview of the types of tests that are being applied for
detecting Covid. It is made clear that one cannot just simply compare
one test with another. Especially when they are applied in different

scale testing program. Module 4, explained about continues monitoring
and quality assurance of a testing site. And in this module, the set-up
